        <h5>From the article "Personalized microbiome-driven effects of non- nutritive sweeteners on human glucose tolerance"</h5>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="intro">"Zero-sugar""Zero-calorie" are common in our daily life. People often consume products with these labels for a healthy diet. 
        But recently, a study of the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on human metabolism as well as their microbiomes reveals how these can induce individual-specific, microbiome-dependent changes to glycemic responses, warranting follow-up clinical studies to understand long-term impact.

        <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
        <p class="intro">"Zero-sugar", "Zero-calorie" are common in our daily life. People often consume products with these labels for a healthy diet. 
        But recently, a study of the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on human metabolism as well as their microbiomes reveals how these can induce individual-specific, microbiome-dependent changes to glycemic responses, warranting follow-up clinical studies to understand long-term impact.

                Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are commonly integrated into human diet and presumed to be inert; however, animal studies suggest that they may impact the microbiome and downstream glycemic responses. We causally assessed NNS impacts in humans and their microbiomes in a randomized-controlled trial encom- passing 120 healthy adults, administered saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia sachets for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake, compared with controls receiving sachet-contained vehicle glucose or no supplement. As groups, each administered NNS distinctly altered stool and oral microbiome and plasma metabolome, whereas saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic responses. Importantly, gnotobiotic mice conventionalized with microbiomes from multiple top and bottom responders of each of the four NNS-supplemented groups featured glycemic responses largely reflecting those noted in respective human donors, which were preempted by distinct microbial signals, as exemplified by sucralose. Collectively, human NNS consumption may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations, necessitating future assessment of clinical implications.

        <p class="intro">These four types of artificial sweeteners are widely used in our daily products, especially flavored food, whose examples are listed above. Now let's see how the paper investigated the influence of these sweeteners.</p>
        <h3><u>Method</u></h3>
        <p class="method">
        The study consisted of three phases: 7 days of baseline measurements of metabolic, metabolomic, and microbial parameters were followed by 14 days of exposure to the various nutritional interventions, after which supplementation was ceased and participants were followed up for 7 additional days. To determine the effect of NNS on glycemic control, participants wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) throughout the 29 days of the trial, and glucose tolerance tests were performed on predetermined days. Anthropometrics and blood tests were conducted on days 0, 14, and 28. Microbiome samples from the stool and the oral cavity were collected at predetermined time points. Participants logged all food intake and physical activity in real time using a dedicated smartphone application.

        <h3><u>Results</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Saccharin and sucralose impair glucose tolerance in healthy adults</li>
            <li> Non-nutritive sweeteners functionally modulate the human gut and oral microbiomes.</li>
            <li>Microbiome features correlate with NNS impacts on the human glycemic response</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sucralose as this NNS is poorly absorbed and is more likely to interact with the intestinal microbiome.</li>
                    <li>The sucralose group displayed greater person-to-person heteroge- neity, providing an opportunity to elucidate microbiome and metabolome contributions to personalized glycemic responses.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Causative personalized impacts of NNS-modulated microbiome on glycemic responses.</li>
            <li>Microbiome features correlate with person-specific variations in glycemic responses to NNS</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Notably, all four tested NNS (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia) significantly and distinctly altered the human intestinal and oral microbiome, as would be expected for these chemically diverse compounds. </p>
